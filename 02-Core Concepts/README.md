# 02-Core Concepts
## CSS specifications and the W3C
>-The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C for short develop web standards and guidelines including the technical specifications for CSS.  
-W3C guidelines is a little intimidating, because it includes a lot of jargon and quite extensive terms for newbies but since the W3C is responsible for establishing these rules, you'll probably end up looking at it at some point.  
-The first two versions of CSS, Level 1 and Level 2, published all the specification as one whole document. After Level 2, the W3C decided to split the specification into independent modules to allow for faster incremental changes. Each module can level up independently. [*therefore CSS does n't have versions in the traditional sense; instead it has levels.*](https://dev.to/afif/when-we-will-have-css4-o9o)  
-[on W3C table of CSS specifications](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) You may see some marked as Level 3 if it's an update from CSS2. New modules such as flexbox start out at Level 1. There are others marked at Level 4. So these levels have no relation to the version of CSS. So while CSS3 basically refers to any updates after CSS Level 2, there's really no need to make the distinction. It's all just CSS. [check here for more info](https://dev.to/afif/when-we-will-have-css4-o9o)  
-All of the past, current, and working drafts are published on the W3C website. Status codes are included to indicate what phase the particular module is at. [status code reference](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work)
