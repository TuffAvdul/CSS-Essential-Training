typeface or font family-It's the design of lettering that can include variations in size, weight (e.g. bold), slope (e.g. italic), width (e.g. condensed), and so on.

font-It refers to a particular weight, width, and style within that typeface.
<table>
    <tr><td>For example, Helvetica is a well known typeface. So, 12 point Helvetica is a font, and 10 point Helvetica is a separate font. The same goes for different weights â€“ a 14 point Helvetica Bold is a different font than a 14 pt Helvetica Light. They are different fonts, but the same typeface. <br><a href="https://hobancards.com/blogs/thoughts-and-curiosities/difference-between-font-and-typeface">Full descriptions</a></td>
