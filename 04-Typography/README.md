>-though trends may change, you should make sure you're using legible fonts

typeface or font family-It's the design of lettering that can include variations in size, weight (e.g. bold), slope (e.g. italic), width (e.g. condensed), and so on.

font-It refers to a particular weight, width, and style within that typeface.
<table>
    <tr><td>For example, Helvetica is a well known typeface. So, 12 point Helvetica is a font, and 10 point Helvetica is a separate font. The same goes for different weights â€“ a 14 point Helvetica Bold is a different font than a 14 pt Helvetica Light. They are different fonts, but the same typeface. <br><a href="https://hobancards.com/blogs/thoughts-and-curiosities/difference-between-font-and-typeface">Full descriptions</a></td>

## Changing the font-family
>-To set the typeface in CSS, use the `font-family` property. The first value is your first choice. The following options are fallback alternatives. This list is referred to as a **font stack**.
>```css
>body {
>    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
>}
>```
>-There's no limit to the number of font options to include but two or three is pretty standard. You should at least have your preferred font, followed by a generic font last. If the user's OS doesn't have a particular font-family installed, it will default to the next item on the list.
